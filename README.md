# AT&T Hackathon 2014 (Freshman Yr Wk 2)
First ever hackathon experince. Our team made a basic web interface using elements from [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com). Aaron Franco, who was a volunteer at the Hackathon, added an API (Datadipity) call to send text message when the signup button was clicked. Thank you Aaron Franco.

Info on the [AT&T In App Messaging API with Datadipity can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EYbI0_RNN2lgZnLQwPAyDf9CL4e-4YYVDBZgIvqbFEM/edit)
